## 🔐 Security Architecture

### SecurityManager Class
The core security system is implemented through the `SecurityManager` class which provides:

- **Encryption/Decryption**: Secure data handling
- **Session Management**: Token-based authentication
- **Rate Limiting**: Brute force protection
- **Input Validation**: XSS and injection prevention
- **Activity Monitoring**: Security event tracking

### Security Layers
1. **Client-Side Encryption**: Data encrypted before storage
2. **Session Security**: Secure token management
3. **Input Validation**: Comprehensive sanitization
4. **Activity Monitoring**: Real-time threat detection
5. **Rate Limiting**: Attack prevention mechanisms

## 🛠️ Security Configuration

### Session Settings
```javascript
sessionTimeout: 30 * 60 * 1000,    // 30 minutes
maxLoginAttempts: 5,                // Maximum login attempts
lockoutTime: 15 * 60 * 1000        // 15 minutes lockout
```

### Password Requirements
```javascript
minLength: 8,
requireUppercase: true,
requireLowercase: true,
requireNumbers: true,
requireSpecialChars: true
```
